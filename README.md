# Spam-Mail-Classification-by-Using-NLP-and-ML
**Overview**
This project implements a spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to classify emails into two categories: "Spam" and "Ham" (non-spam). The system leverages various NLP preprocessing steps and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in email content and determine whether the email is spam.

**Features**
**Text Preprocessing:** The emails are cleaned and preprocessed using common NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
**Feature Extraction:** The project uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert email text into numerical vectors that can be used for classification.
**Machine Learning Models:** Different classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are employed to train the model and predict the label (Spam/Ham).
**Evaluation Metrics:** The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Installation**
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

pandas for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
nltk for natural language processing
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization (optional)
You can install the required libraries using pip:
pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn
**Usage**
Data Loading: The project uses a labeled dataset of emails, which is typically in CSV format, with columns like "Email Text" and "Label" (Spam/Ham).

Preprocessing: The email text undergoes preprocessing steps such as lowercasing, removing special characters, and eliminating stopwords to prepare the data for feature extraction.

Feature Extraction: The TF-IDF vectorizer is used to convert the processed email text into numerical vectors that can be fed into the machine learning model.

Model Training: The chosen machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes) is trained on the processed dataset.

Prediction: Once the model is trained, it can predict whether a new email is spam or not based on the features extracted from the email content.

Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and a confusion matrix is displayed for a deeper analysis of the modelâ€™s predictions.
