# Spam-Mail-Classification-by-Using-NLP-and-ML
**Overview**
This project implements a spam email classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to classify emails into two categories: "Spam" and "Ham" (non-spam). The system leverages various NLP preprocessing steps and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in email content and determine whether the email is spam.

**Features**
**Text Preprocessing:** The emails are cleaned and preprocessed using common NLP techniques such as tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming.
**Feature Extraction:** The project uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert email text into numerical vectors that can be used for classification.
**Machine Learning Models:** Different classification algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), are employed to train the model and predict the label (Spam/Ham).
**Evaluation Metrics:** The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Installation**
To run this project, you will need Python 3.x and the following Python libraries:

pandas for data manipulation
scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms
nltk for natural language processing
matplotlib and seaborn for visualization (optional)
You can install the required libraries using pip:
